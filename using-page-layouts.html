    <h2 id="Formatting_playlists">Formatting playlists</h2>
    <p>You have flexibility when placing playlists on a page. If you click the three ellipsis (three dots) next to the playlist name</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">

    <h2 id="Playlist_Grid">Playlist Grid</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Playlist Grid</strong> page layout:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>Playlist Grid</strong> displays one or more playlists in grids, meaning thumbnails for all the videos in the playlist will appear on the page. If multiple playlists are selected the playlists names will appear as tabs at the top of the app page, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/playlist-grid-wide.png" alt="grid page">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Note that if only one playlist is displayed no playlist name will appear. In this case, you would want to be sure the page name reflected the content of the playlist.</li>
      <li>
        The page layout is responsive. The following screenshot shows the same page previously shown, but at a narrower browser width. Note the the thumbnails are only four across whereas in the wider browser they were five across.
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/playlist-grid-narrow.png" alt="narrower grid">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the number of playlists added to the page makes the playlist name tabs wider than space available, an arrow is added to the right side of the tab list to provide a way to see all the tabs, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/many-tabs.png" alt="arrow for tabs">
        </figure>
        Once you reach the end, the arrow appears on the left side.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Hero_Autoplay_Channel">Hero (Autoplay Channel)</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Hero (Autoplay Channel)</strong> page layout:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature a channel as fullscreen, autoplaying video. Play the following video to see the behavior.
        <iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.html?videoId=1700212308193411817" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" width="790" height="400"></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>Additional playlists display as carousels.</li>
      <li>Valid video content for the playlist with channel are:
        <ul>
          <li>A {{ site.product }} channel</li>
          <li>A Cloud Playout channel created in Studio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The page is responsive. The playing video reduces in size and the carousels' thumbnails shrink in size and fewer are displayed.</li>
      <li>No layout changes are allowed on the autoplay channel.</li>
      <li>There is a fallback feature that can be confusing if you are not aware of it. If for some reason the featured autoplay playlist cannot play, the first playlist in the normal list of playlist will be "promoted" into the autoplay position. The following diagram further clarifies the feature:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/hero-autoplay.png" alt="hero autoplay fallback">

    </ul>

    <h2 id="Hero_Featured_Playlist">Hero (Featured Playlist)</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Hero (Featured Playlist)</strong> page layout:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The featured playlist appears at the top of the page with its thumbnails larger within a carousel than other playlists' thumbnails on the page, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/hero-playlist-wide.png" alt="hero playlist wide">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>As seen in the screenshot just above, additional playlists added to the page display below the featured playlist in carousels, using smaller thumbnails.</li>
      <li>The page layout is responsive. The following screenshot shows the same page previously shown, but at a narrower browser width. Note the the thumbnails are only two across for the featured playlist whereas in the wider browser they were three across.
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/hero-playlist-narrow.png" alt="hero playlist narrow">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>In the featured playlist, you do not have the option to display the thumbnails in portrait orientation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Hero_Image">Hero (Image)</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Hero (Image)</strong> page layout:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Additional playlists display as carousels.</li>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Carousels">Carousels</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Carousels</strong> page layout:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new carousels is added for each playlist placed on the page, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/carousels.png" alt="carousels">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>A chevron <img src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/using-page-layouts/chevron.png" alt="chevron"> appears at either end of carousel for navigation to all the videos in the playlist.</li>
